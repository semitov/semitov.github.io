#  A Guide to Software Engineer Task Force (SemiTO-V)

## Active Projects
- [SemiTO-V Board QEMU Implementation](https://github.com/semitov/SemiTOV-Board)
- [SemiTO-V MCL](https://github.com/semitov/SemiTOV-MCL)

## Beginner Wiki
If you are just starting from zero, or you don't feel so confident about your knowledge, we suggest you to read some of the following resources in order to get in touch with RISC-V:
- [Easy RISC-V](https://dramforever.github.io/easyriscv/): a little interactive guide, to get a better knowledge of basic RISC-V assembly.
- [OS in 1000 lines](https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/en/): build a small OS step-by-step.
## Road Map
The Software Task Force has different focuses at the moment, while we wait to have some hardware from the other task forces, we already have important tasks which we aim to realize in short term. In particular we want to:
- Complete the SemiTO-V Board implementation on QEMU: this will grant us the possibility to develop more software and firmware, without having the physical SoC with us all the time.
- Develop a test suite for our core(s): once produced, the cores will still need to be heavily tested even at software level, we need therefore a test suite (mostly written in assembly) to ensure that everything is working as intended.
