Welcome to our website! *SemiTO-V* is an upcoming student team at [Polytechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/en) that uses open standard [RISC-V ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V) based cores to create custom processors, firmware, and software as well as our own PCB designs (for our own processors and ready ones). We’re mastering everything from circuit analysis to processor architecture, and from RTL design to low-level software development for RISC-V ISA (RV32 and potentially RV64).

Check out [about us page](about) and [projects page](projects) to learn more about our work. Check [team page](team) to see the people that are behind SemiTO-V.
