Welcome to our website! *SemiTO-V* is an upcoming RISC-V oriented student community organized by students of [Polytechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/en) that uses open standard [RISC-V ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V) to create custom processors, firmware, and software as well as our own PCB designs (for our own processors and ones that are already produced), and share them with the world fully open source. Weâ€™re mastering everything from circuit analysis to processor architecture, and from RTL design to low-level software development for RISC-V ISA (RV32 and potentially RV64).

Check out [about us page](about) and [projects page](projects) to learn more about our work. Check [team page](team) to see the people that are behind SemiTO-V.

If you don't know much about RISC-V ISA and ecosystem but want to learn more, we suggest you to check out following links:
